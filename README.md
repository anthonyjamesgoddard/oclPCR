# Parallel Cyclic Reduction in OpenCL

<<<<<<< HEAD
A simple implemention of Parallel Cyclic Reduction in OpenCL. 
We have also included an alternative implementation that calls
on the Thomas algorithm when the file size gets small enough.
=======
There are a few implementations floating about.
This one removes any reliance on having nVidia
hardware. While git says this is in C++ it is in
C. 

IDEAS:

    (1) Convert this to C++ using ocl wrapper
